# Hi, I'm Ed. 👋
### I'm a full stack developer with a background in technical support and consulting. My passion for self-directed learning has led me to master diverse skills, from navigating various Linux distributions to achieving conversational fluency in Chinese and creating electronic music. I thrive on acquiring new knowledge and applying it across different domains.  

I'm interested in:
- 🇨🇳Learning Chinese (and in the future, other languages) [**through immersion**](https://refold.la/explained#philosophySection) 
- 🏉  Playing and watching all kinds of [**sports**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football)
- 🎧  [**Making**](https://soundcloud.com/ramcee) and listening to weird music
