### My journey in Tech 
I'm a relative late comer to software as a career. I landed my first development job at the age of 28, after spending the early part of my career consulting and doing level 2 support for a healthcare software company, and going back to school to get my Masters in Information Technology.

Right from the point at which I decided I wanted to get into coding, I was recommended by a friend to check out linux, and I was hooked from the beginning. I was amazed by how customisable everything was, I loved the idea that basically anything was possible as long as you were willing to dig through the documentation and troubleshoot your problems, and I especially loved the feeling of satisfaction I got when I managed to configure my operating system in *just* the right way. Throughout my linux journey i've dabbled with Ubuntu, Manjaro, Arch and most recently NixOS, and 

Naturally, when I asked that same friend what text editor to use, he recommended vim. At first, it was a clunky, slightly frustrating experience, but after a while it started to click, and almost felt like a minigame that I could play while I coded things. On top of that, just like with linux, the ability to tinker with and customise vim was endless and I got just as much satisfaction out of setting up my development environment as I got from actually coding.

My first gig as a developer was at Blackbook.ai, where I worked primarily on a project with Aurizon. On this project, my time was split between working as a "data wrangler" and doing full stack development. My work as the unofficial "data wrangler" involved a lot of manual data handling processes, and I looked to automate these processes as soon as possible. That experience highlighted the value of automation in a really personal and visceral way for me.

Piecing together my interest in linux, automation and work experience up to this point, i've landed on Site Reliability Engineering as a good way to leverage my skillset, and that's where i'm looking to take my next steps along this journey.
