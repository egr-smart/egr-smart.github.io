Have you ever stared out the window of your classroom as a child, having a nice day dream about being outside and playing in the sun, only to suddenly have that nice moment ruined by your teacher yelling “Pay attention!” at you? Subsequently, did you ever wonder how that phrase ‘pay attention’ came to be? Is attention a currency or commodity, something that is spent, like money? What is the intrinsic value of my attention that I’m spending each moment? What do I get in return for spending my attention? Only to have the teacher yell once again “Ed, if my class is that boring to you, you are welcome to spend the rest of the class in the principal’s office!”.

I believe the reason we say “pay attention” is because attention is a valuable commodity, and hence, parting with it comes at a cost to ourselves. So, what exactly makes attention valuable? Think for a second about what attention is. Look at your surroundings now, and notice that whatever your eyes rest on, whatever sounds your ears pick out, whatever part of your body you feel or whatever thought you’re wrestling with in any given moment is the thing you’re paying attention to. We are always paying attention, no matter if we’re focusing on a lecture, or absent-mindedly day dreaming. Our attention is our moment to moment experience of life – when we choose to pay attention to something, we are really making a decision on how we will spend a portion of our lives. However minuscule that portion of our lives may be, once passed, it is gone forever. Unlike with monetary transactions, there are no refunds if you’re not happy with your purchase.

Now we know the value of attention, let’s consider what you might get in return for spending it. When you spend money, broadly speaking, you get things in return – products, goods, services and experiences. Spending attention, by contrast, is a slightly more nuanced transaction. If you pay attention in class, you might also receive things like good grades, or understanding of new or difficult concepts, but I see those mostly as side effects. I believe the most important result of the attention transaction is the quality of your life. Above all else, consider how you feel when spend attention on things like:

- Your relationships with friends and family
- Pursuing difficult goals
- Exercising your body
- Exploring new and interesting concepts

Versus how you feel when you spend your attention on things like:

- Doom scrolling social media
- Mindlessly shopping online for things you don’t really need
- Watching porn
- Playing video games for 5 hours a day

For me, words like fulfilled, energised, excited, hopeful and rewarding came up when reading the first list, and words like regret, depressed, disappointed and low energy came up for the second list. I hope it’s starting to become clear now, that what you choose to spend your attention on directly results in the quality of life you experience moment to moment.

Nowadays, we have numerous compelling things all vying for our attention. I hope that in the future, before you blindly throw your attention at something, you might consider the transaction you’re about to make. Remember what your attention is worth, and make sure that you’re getting your money’s worth!

P.S. I know from experience that addiction to social media and other internet-based attention stealing platforms is a very real and difficult thing to overcome, and it might take more than just intention to redirect your attention to things that will improve your quality of life. In the future I plan to write a post about redefining one’s relationship with these technologies, so look out for that if you’re in that predicament.
